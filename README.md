# MatrixNTFScan

## Overview

Below shows the rarity and count of all the publicly known attributes for Niftys Matrix NFTs.  

There are two jupyter notebooks with one what scrapes the Nifty Matrix site and pulls the attributes per NTF then writes it out to a file.  The second then aggregates the files together into a dataframe then displays count and percentages

 Iâ€™m personally excited about 2022 and what this journey will entail so m

Please note this is a work in progress and I will update the attribute files periodically based on changes I see in on the site.  Also, this site is for informational purposes only.   

Lastly, if you find this information useful then buy me a coffee @ vinceherrin.eth
